"I'm looking to build a web application for an AI voice agent that enables natural conversations between users and an AI assistant. Key requirements:

Technical Requirements:

\- Real-time speech-to-text transcription of user's voice input

\- Natural language processing to understand user intent

\- Text-to-speech synthesis for AI responses

\- Voice streaming capability with low latency

\- WebRTC or similar for handling audio I/O

\- Web interface with microphone controls and conversation display

Features:

\- Voice activation/wake word detection

\- Conversation history tracking

\- Multiple voice/personality options for the AI

\- Error handling for audio issues

\- Visual feedback during listening/processing

\- Support for common browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

\- Optional text input fallback

User Experience:

\- Simple, intuitive microphone controls

\- Clear visual indicators for system status

\- Smooth conversational flow

\- Minimal setup required

\- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

Additional Considerations:

\- Privacy policy for voice data handling

\- Speech recognition accuracy metrics

\- Fallback options for low bandwidth

\- Voice activity detection

\- Noise cancellation

\- Session management

\- Performance optimization

Could you help design the architecture and recommend specific technologies/APIs for implementing these requirements?
