# Contributing to AI Voice Agent

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI Voice Agent project. This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to our enterprise-grade voice interaction platform.

Our mission is to deliver a high-quality, secure, and accessible voice interaction experience. Your contributions help us achieve this goal while maintaining our high standards for code quality and security.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed with the specified versions:

- Node.js >= 20.0.0 LTS
- pnpm >= 8.0.0
- Docker >= 24.0.0
- VS Code (latest version)
- Git >= 2.0.0

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-voice-agent

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d
pnpm dev
```

### VS Code Configuration

Recommended extensions:
- ESLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
- Docker
- Jest Runner
- GitLens

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Maintain 80% or higher code coverage
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling

### Documentation Requirements

- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include type definitions for interfaces and functions
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep README files up to date
- Add inline comments for complex logic

### Performance Guidelines

- Implement proper memoization for expensive operations
- Use lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Follow React performance best practices
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

```text
feature/<issue-number>-description
bugfix/<issue-number>-description
hotfix/<issue-number>-description
release/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

### Commit Message Format

```text
feat(<scope>): add voice activity detection
fix(<scope>): resolve WebSocket connection issue
docs(<scope>): update API documentation
test(<scope>): add unit tests for auth service
chore(<scope>): update dependencies
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `main` using the naming convention
2. Implement changes with appropriate tests
3. Ensure all tests pass and coverage meets requirements
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit PR with detailed description
6. Address review comments
7. Maintain PR updates until merged

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing

- Use Jest for unit testing
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Follow AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern

### Integration Testing

- Test API endpoints comprehensively
- Verify WebSocket functionality
- Test database operations
- Validate authentication flows
- Test rate limiting functionality

### End-to-End Testing

- Use Cypress for E2E testing
- Test critical user flows
- Verify voice processing pipeline
- Test error recovery scenarios
- Validate browser compatibility

## Security Requirements

### Code Security

- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting
- Follow least privilege principle

### Dependency Management

- Use only approved dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run security audits regularly
- Document security implications
- Follow SemVer for versioning

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow data retention policies
- Handle PII appropriately
- Implement audit logging

### Security Review Process

1. Automated security scanning
2. Manual security review
3. Vulnerability assessment
4. Penetration testing
5. Security documentation review

## Vulnerability Reporting
