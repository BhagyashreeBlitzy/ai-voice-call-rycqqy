- Token expiration: 15 minutes (as per authConfig.jwtExpiresIn)
- Refresh token rotation
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Redis-based session management
- Token blacklisting for revoked access

### Rate Limiting
```json
{
  "auth_endpoints": "10/minute",
  "voice_processing": "100/minute",
  "text_operations": "1000/minute",
  "websocket_connections": "1/user",
  "burst_allowance": {
    "auth": 2,
    "voice": 10,
    "text": 50
  }
}
```

### Data Protection
- Voice Data: AES-256-GCM encryption
- User Credentials: Argon2id hashing
- Session Data: AES-256-CBC encryption
- Key Rotation: 30-day cycle
- Encrypted backups
- PII data encrypted at rest
